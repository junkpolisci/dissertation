	abstract = {This article focuses on former Spanish President José María Aznar and his party, the Partido Popular, and analyzes the evolution of their core values and public images from the beginning to the end of the two political periods they were in power. Particular attention is paid to the government’s management of the Prestige oil tanker ecological catastrophe, Spanish involvement in the Iraq War, and the March 11 terrorist attack in Spain with respect to the impact these events had on the 2004 Spanish election results.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the impact that two terrorism-related matters had on Spanish politics and electoral processes in the country. First, the article analyzes the terrorist attacks perpetrated by jihadists on March 11, 2004, three days before Spain's general election. The indiscriminate, lethal attacks caused a state of shock in the country, brought the election campaign to a sudden end, and led to the defeat of the party in power. Second, the article analyzes the negotiations entered into with the ETA terrorist organization by the new government during its first term, from 2004 to 2008. This controversial step, upheld by the Spanish government despite massive opposition by civil society and the main opposition party, failed to bring about the end of ETA. Both the Madrid attacks and the negotiations with ETA were responsible for the breakdown of the consensus in regard to terrorism that had existed among the main Spanish political parties. The article analyzes how both events generated an unprecedented level of polarization and tension among political parties and society from 2004 to 2008, and how each event had a different impact on the general elections held during that period. The period under examination provides an example of adversarial politics; terrorism was highly influenced by the management of both events by the main political players.},
