* @alonso2013 suggests that the party in power in Spain struggled as a result of terrorism in two cases. First, the Partido Popular (PP), the nationalist conservative party in Spain, lost its 2004 election in no small part because of its mismanagement of the fallout of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Second, the national consensus on fighting terrorism was broken when the PSOE (Partido Socialista Obredor Espanol), the socialist party, did not stop negotiations in 2006 after ETA broken their 2005 truce. 
    - @rigo2005 also argues that Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister from the PP, and the PP in general lost in the 2004 election because of his treatment of the post-11M recovery.
